completable-futures is a set of utility functions to simplify working with asynchronous code in
Java8.

## Usage

Using `completable-futures` requires Java 8 but has no additional dependencies. It is meant to be
included as a library in other software. To import it with maven, add this to your pom:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.spotify</groupId>
    <artifactId>completable-futures</artifactId>
    <version>0.3.1</version>
</dependency>
```

## Features

### Combining more than two things

The builtin CompletableFuture API includes `future.thenCombine(otherFuture, function)` but if you
want to combine more than two things it gets trickier. The `CompletableFutures` class contains the
following APIs to simplify this use-case:

#### allAsList

If you want to join a list of futures of uniform type, use `allAsList`. This returns a future which
completes to a list of all values of its inputs:

```java
List<CompletableFuture<String>> futures = asList(completedFuture("a"), completedFuture("b"));
CompletableFuture<List<String>> joined = CompletableFutures.allAsList(futures);
```

#### successfulAsList

Works like `allAsList`, but futures that fail will not fail the joined future. Instead, the
defaultValueMapper function will be called once for each failed future and value returned will be
put in the resulting list on the place corresponding to the failed future. The default value
returned by the function may be anything, such as `null` or `Optional.empty()`.

```java
List<CompletableFuture<String>> input = asList(
    completedFuture("a"),
    exceptionallyCompletedFuture(new RuntimeException("boom")));
CompletableFuture<List<String>> joined = CompletableFutures.successfulAsList(input, t -> "default");
```

#### joinList

`joinList` is a stream collector that combines multiple futures into a list. This is handy if you
apply an asynchronous operation to a collection of entities:

```java
collection.stream()
    .map(this::someAsyncFunction)
    .collect(CompletableFutures.joinList())
    .thenApply(this::consumeList)
```

#### combine

If you want to combine more than two futures of different types, use the `combine` method:

```java
CompletableFutures.combine(f1, f2, (a, b) -> a + b);
CompletableFutures.combine(f1, f2, f3, (a, b, c) -> a + b + c);
CompletableFutures.combine(f1, f2, f3, f4, (a, b, c, d) -> a + b + c + d);
CompletableFutures.combine(f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, (a, b, c, d, e) -> a + b + c + d + e);
```

#### combineFutures

If you want to combine multiple futures into another future, use `combineFutures`:

```java
CompletableFutures.combineFutures(f1, f2, (a, b) -> completedFuture(a + b));
CompletableFutures.combineFutures(f1, f2, f3, (a, b, c) -> completedFuture(a + b + c));
CompletableFutures.combineFutures(f1, f2, f3, f4, (a, b, c, d) -> completedFuture(a + b + c + d));
CompletableFutures.combineFutures(f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, (a, b, c, d, e) -> completedFuture(a + b + c + d + e));
```

### Scheduling

#### Polling an external resource

If you are dealing with a long-running external task that only exposes a polling API, you can
transform that into a future like so:

```java
Supplier<Optional<T>> pollingTask = () -> Optional.ofNullable(resource.result());
Duration frequency = Duration.ofSeconds(2);
CompletableFuture<T> result = CompletableFutures.poll(pollingTask, frequency, executor);
```

### Missing parts of the CompletableFuture API

The `CompletableFutures` class includes utility functions for operating on futures that is missing
from the builtin API.

#### handleCompose

Like `CompletableFuture.handle` but lets you return a new `CompletionStage` instead of a
direct value.

```java
CompletionStage<String> composed = handleCompose(future, (value, throwable) -> completedFuture("hello"));
```

#### exceptionallyCompose

Like `CompletableFuture.exceptionally` but lets you return a new `CompletionStage` instead of a
direct value.

```java
CompletionStage<String> composed = CompletableFutures.exceptionallyCompose(future, throwable -> completedFuture("fallback"));
```

#### dereference

Unwrap a `CompletionStage<CompletionStage<T>>` to a plain `CompletionStage<T>`.

```java
CompletionStage<CompletionStage<String>> wrapped = completedFuture(completedFuture("hello"));
CompletionStage<String> unwrapped = CompletableFutures.dereference(wrapped);
```

#### exceptionallyCompletedFuture

Creates a new future that is already exceptionally completed with the given exception.

```java
return CompletableFutures.exceptionallyCompletedFuture(new RuntimeException("boom"));
```
